## ROBOT Design Changes:
- Using Tank Treads to turn without moving from one spot.
- Catapult vs. Trebuchet vs. Crossbow?
  - Decided on Crossbow/launcher
  - Decided on Elastic to launch disk like a slingshot/crossbow

*Primitive launch setup. The disk will load onto the track. A rubber band, seated on two wheels, holds the disk in place. A gear (on the bottom) pulls the rubber band back along the track. A pin will raise/lower, then the disk launches.*
