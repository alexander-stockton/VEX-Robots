## Objectives

### Minimum Requirements
Our primary objective is to design and control a **remote-operated disk launcher robot**. The robot will be controlled via a remote with a button to manually launch each loaded disk.

At a minimum, the robot should be able to:
- [ ] Hold **at least one** disk-ammunition slot
- [ ] **Move** based on user input from a remote control
- [ ] **Turn** left or right in place (pivoting without linear movement)
- [ ] **Adjust the pitch angle** of the disk launcher (increase/decrease)
- [ ] **Launch a disk**

---

### Ideal Goals
Our ultimate goal is to design an **autonomous disk-launching robot**.

This robot should be able to:
- [ ] **Automatically collect ammunition**
- [ ] **Chamber ammunition** in preparation for launch
- [ ] **Locate a persistent target** from any position on the field
- [ ] **Calculate a launch trajectory**, including both horizontal and vertical angles
- [ ] **Launch the disk** a set time after target acquisition
