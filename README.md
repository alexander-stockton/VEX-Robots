Our primary objective is to design and control a remote-operated disk-launcher. The robot will be controlled by a remote with a button to launch each manually-loaded disk. At the bare minimum, the robot should:
  - Contain at least one disk-ammunition slot
  - Move in response to user-input on a connected remote control
  - Turn left or right on a point without changing position
  - Increase and decrease the pitching angle of the disk
  - Launch a disk
Our ultimate goal is to design a robot that, given any location on the field, collects ammunition, chambers it, locates a persistent target, calculates the horizontal and vertical angles at which to launch the disk to hit that target. In an ideal scenario, the robot will:
  - Automatically collect ammunition
  - Automatically chamber ammunition to prepare for launching
  - Automatically find the specified target from any given position
  - Automatically calculate the launch trajectory
  - Launch a disk a set time after locating the specified target
